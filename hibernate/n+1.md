# What is the N+1 query problem

The N+1 query problem happens when the data access framework executed N additional SQL statements to fetch the same data that could have been retrieved when executing the primary SQL query.

The larger the value of N, the more queries will be executed, the larger the performance impact. And, unlike the slow query log that can help you find slow running queries, the N+1 issue wonâ€™t be spot because each individual additional query runs sufficiently fast to not trigger the slow query log.

 the fix is to use direct SQL statement (using @Query)
