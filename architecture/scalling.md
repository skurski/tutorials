# The scalability solution

__scalability__ is a desirable property of a system, a network, or a process, which indicates its ability to handle growing amounts of work in a graceful manner.


There are two kinds of scalability strategies:

* Scale up (Scale vertically) means to run the application on a stronger computer.

* Scale out (scale horizontally) means to run the application on many regular computers.
