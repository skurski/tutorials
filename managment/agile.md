# Agile

## Agile Manifesto

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

## Scrum framework

### Scrum roles
 
* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Development Team Member

### Scrum events

* Sprint
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, a Sprint, a time-box 
    of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, 
    and potentially releasable product Increment is created.
* Sprint Planning
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, the work to be performed 
    in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan 
    is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.
* Daily Scrum
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, the Daily Scrum is a 
    15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to 
    synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 
    24 hours. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint.
* Sprint Review
    * During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders 
     collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that
     and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, 
     attendees collaborate on the next things that could be 
     done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not 
     a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment 
     is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.
* Sprint Retrospective
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, the Sprint Retrospective 
    is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself 
    and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during 
    the next Sprint.
* Product backlog refinement
    * Product backlog refinement—sometimes called product 
    backlog grooming in reference to keeping the backlog 
    clean and orderly—is a meeting that is held near the 
    end of one sprint to ensure the backlog is ready for the
     next sprint. 
    * During a product backlog refinement meeting, the team 
     and product owner discuss the top items on the product 
     backlog. The team is given a chance to ask the questions 
     that would normally arise during sprint planning:

### Scrum artefacts

* Product Backlog
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, the Product Backlog is 
    an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed 
    in the product. It is the single source of requirements 
    for any changes to be made to the product. 
    The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, 
    including its content, availability, and ordering.
* Sprint Backlog
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, the Sprint Backlog is 
    the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, 
    plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and 
    realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a 
    forecast by the Development Team about what functionality 
    will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver
     that functionality into a “Done” Increment.
* Increment
    * As described in the Scrum Guide, an Increment is the sum 
    of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint 
    and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints. 
    At the end of a Sprint, the new Increment must be “Done,” 
    which means it must be in useable condition and meet the 
    Scrum Team’s definition of “Done.”
